1. select a given emotion
2. select all position one edges for given emotion with given threshold (e.g. all rows that have a weight less than 0.5)
3. select all position two edges for given emotion with given threshold (e.g. all rows that have a weight less than 0.5)
4. select all position three edges for given emotion with given threshold (e.g. all rows that have a weight less than 0.5)
5. check to see if any of the lowest-weight edges are related nodes (i.e. do they connect in the graph?)
6. return results

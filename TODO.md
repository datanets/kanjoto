## TODO:
- add spinners for velocity in CreateNotesetActivity
- add spinners for length in CreateNotesetActivity
- add "delete noteset" feature
- add "edit noteset" feature
- connect up "view noteset details" activity


## DONE:
- 20140913: added "emotion spinner lists get data from emotion database table rows" functionality
- 20140913: added "create emotion" feature
- 20140913: added "view all emotions" feature
- 20140913: added emotion database table
- 20140913: added menu create button (and menu settings button) to "view all notesets" activity
- 20140913: fixed crash that happens when switching to landscape view in MainActivity
- 20140912: added "end music playback" functionality (when exiting GenerateMusicActivity)
- 20140911: added playback of generated midi file
- 20140910: added "write chosen notesets to midi file" feature
- 20140910: added random noteset picker (using gathered data structure)

- 20140906: added database import feature

- 20140902: create new noteset + create related notes in database
- 20140901: separate out notesets and notes
- 20140901: separate database opener and data source methods


## DATABASE:
#### emotions
- id
- name

#### notes
- id
- noteset_id
- notevalue
- velocity
- length

#### notesets
- id
- name


## NOTES:
- approaches to try first for generating music:
  - Approach 1:
    - gather related notes from database based on given emotion
    - convert query results into individual "noteset bundles"
    - randomly choose from list of "noteset bundles"
  - Approach 2:
    - randomly query database for notesets and notes based on given emotion
